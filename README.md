### Advent of Code 2024

This is my attempt at the Advent of Code 2024.  For the moment I have chosen to use Fortran as the programming language as I am wanting to gain more experience with it that coding nick knacks and small trivial programs to help my son understand mathematics at school.

I will be doing this at my own pace, using code snippets that I have written, libraries that I have created and calling on previous projects that I have done for S&G.

All in all, I intend to have fun, bang my head against the keyboard a few times and curse a lot as I already have as code that worked previously did not work this time.
