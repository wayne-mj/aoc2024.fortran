### I do not know.

The turtle works, it moves around and finds it way out of the room, but finding the distinct path based on the rules, I do not get the same answer per the example.

I get 40 and not 41.

EDIT:

I tried other examples, I get the test to work, but I cannot get the live to to solve.

EDIT 2: Breadcrumbs!

I used breadcrumbs.  As evidenced by the output.txt file, I used "X" to denote the breadcrumbs and when one dropped in a unique location, counted that.
